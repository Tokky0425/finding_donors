    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "    The strength of this algorithm is that it basically works well with any classification problem due to the simplicity of the model. It is also an advantage that its training speed is quite fast. This is because it is a \"lazy-learner\", in which the model is built by just memorizing the training data set without calculating to generate a formula in the training process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Lazy-learner slows down the prediction speed with very large training data because it has to execute the algorithm by referring the training data stored in the model for each test data, which is a major drawback. But it is applicable to the data of this project since it has only about 45K data in total, which is a durable size for this algorithm, according to the first reference below.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This algorithm is used, for example, to predict the voting behavior.\n",

    "- Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two features about Ensemble Methods to note are the fact that they are \"meta-estimator\" and that it builds a model by implementing \"weak learner\" multiple times. \"Meta-estimator\" means that it does not have a classification algorithm by itself. Instead, it uses another estimator (= \"weak learner\"), like decision tree or whatever, multiple times in the process of the training. And it ends up outputting a final estimator by integrating all results implemented by weak learners. There are two ways to integrate the outcome of weak learners, which are bagging and boosting. Bagging is the way to build a final model by averaging the each model of a weak learner. Since it does not care the sequence, each weak learner's implementation is done in parallel. On the other hand, Boosting builds a final model by repeating a weak-learner's execution and updating some status (e.g. weight of a data, residual error, depending on which \"weak-learner\" you use) for the next execution. Since each weak-learner's implementation needs the up-to-date status of training process, it is done sequentially. Boosting generally builds a better performance model, while Bagging works well to avoid overfitting. How Ensemble Methods work well highly depends on which algorithm you use as a weak-learner, but, generally speaking, it builds a better model than that built by a single learner. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    As the cheat sheet of scikit-learn website (the first referrence below) says, it is good to apply this model after you implement K-Nearest Neighbors because it is applicable to the complicated data that K-Nearest Neighbors does not work well on. But which is better, Bagging and Boosting? I would say Boosting is better for this project. One thing to note about Bagging is that it does \"bootstrapping\". Bootstrapping is to make a random patch of the data for training, which is effective to avoid overfitting. But in this project, we are going to check the performance with not only a large amount of data but also a small number of data (like 300), we will not enjoy the full power of bootstrapping, or Bagging. Thus, Boosting seems to be a better choice for this project. Among algorithms of boosing, Adaboost is a major choice. In each iteration of Adaboost, the weights of the data are modified and the model is adjusted in reaction to that. It seems good to try Adaboost as a second model for the project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Like K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Methods are basically applicable to basic classification problem. One of the use cases of this algorithm is fraud detection.\n",

    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "    The unique point of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is that it takes \"margin\" into consideration when calculating its error. By adding margin error to classification error, it can build a model robust against overfitting and well-generalized model. If you give large C parameter to the model, you can enhance the accuracy, and if you give small one, you can alleviate overfitting. SVM is useful in that it takes some kinds of a kernel. By using kernels, such as Polynomial Kernel, RBF (Radio Basis Function) Kernel, you can build a non-linear classification model. But one of the major drawbacks is that the fact that it takes a variety of Kernel makes its tune trickier. Also, when you use the non-lenear kernel, the training time tends to be slow because it builds a complicated model with high dimension.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As the reference (the first reference below) shows, it is good to apply if you place more importance on accuracy than speed. Since the data size is not extremely large in this project, we can expect that training time of SVM is not extremely slow anyway. So it seems reasonable to apply SVM as the third option for this project. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    SVM is also widely used for classification problems, and one of the use cases of this model is face detection.\n",

    "Normaly, the prediction model is made by using only one algorithm. But it is not always accurate because there is no perfect algorithm on the earth. Thus, I used multiple algorithms and integrated the outcome of them, which can enhence the performance of the prediction model. It is same that a decision of a real world should be made by multipe people, not only by one person. Building a strong algorithm in this way is called 'ensemble'. Adaboost is a kind of ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said, this prediction model is built on the outcomes of many execution of an algorithm. And each algorithm is called \"weak-learner\". In Adaboost, the algorithm \"decision trees\" is used as a weak-learner. When the first decision tree make a prediction, the importance of each data are modified in reaction to the result.Concretly, it gives more importance on the misclassified data for the next prediction. Then, the second decision tree is executed based on the modified data. After some iterations, there will be a better model than the previouse model.\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
